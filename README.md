# Model Function Library workbench/prototype

Created with react-static generator version 3.5.7, using typescript template. This project is the test and prototyping platform for a Luonnonvarakeskus (Natural Resources Institute Finland) user interface for browsing and managing a Model Function Library. This is a library of computational models usable in a simulator setting.

## Getting started

You need local Node.js to run or build the project. Choose either direct Node.js installation or use nvm, which allows managing multiple Node.js version. We default to Node.js version 14 in this project. npm command should come bundled with the Node.js installation.

* nvm-windows from https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows. Note that this program requires administrator privileges to install and further when installing Node.js. Take care to install the program into a location accessible by your normal user.
* nvm for Linux/Macintosh from https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
* Bare Node.js for any platform from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### Usage
